# OpenThesis — Engineering Audit

Date: 2026-09-28
Scope: `packages/*`, `tests/*`, CLI, agent skill, repository metadata
Method: full source read of all six packages, plus executable probes rendered against the built `dist/` — every defect below was reproduced, not inferred.

Baseline at audit time: `pnpm check` green, 29 tests passing, `pnpm audit --prod` **failing**.

---

## 1. Headline findings

Four problems made the engine produce wrong output on real templates. All four are
now fixed and covered by regression tests.

### 1.1 The built-in template produced headings identical to body text

`assets/ustb-thesis-template.json` resolved **all 72 styles to one identical
signature** — `Times New Roman / 宋体 / 12pt / justified / no indent`. Levels 1–3
of a nested heading rendered exactly like the surrounding body text, and level 4
rendered as 16pt 仿宋 (the *official-document* body font).

Two independent causes:

1. **`template-parser` read only style-level `w:rPr`** and ignored `w:pPr/w:rPr`,
   which is where Chinese Word/WPS templates put 黑体/三号 for headings.
2. **`rawToParagraphStyle` invented values** (`|| 'Times New Roman'`, `|| '宋体'`,
   `|| 24`, `?? 0`, `mapAlignment(undefined) → 'justified'`), so "the template is
   silent" became indistinguishable from "the template explicitly asks for 12pt".

The second cause is the important one: it is why the renderer could never apply a
sensible default. Verified against a realistic fixture, the parser itself was
correct — the failure was in what it emitted and what the renderer then trusted.

### 1.2 Tables overflowed the page

`renderTable` hardcoded `totalWidth = 8504` (an A4 constant) while the table
declared `<w:tblW w:type="pct" w:w="100%">` — contradictory OOXML.

Reproduced with an 8391-twip page and 1701-twip side margins (printable 4989):
cells still summed to **8504 twips, a 70% overflow** past the right margin.

### 1.3 Tables ignored the template entirely

Cell and caption runs hardcoded `Times New Roman` / 黑体 / 宋体 at 21 half-points.
A template requesting Georgia / 楷体 / 36 half-points was silently overruled; the
`_template` parameter was accepted and never read.

### 1.4 The repository's own CI was failing

`adm-zip@0.6.0` (a production dependency of `@openthesis/equation-engine`) carries
one **high** and one **moderate** advisory, both patched in `0.6.1`.

`pnpm audit --prod --audit-level high` is the last step of `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
The last recorded CI run predates the advisory, so `main` is green on GitHub but
would fail on any push today.

## 2. Findings by severity

Status: **Fixed** = changed in this branch with a regression test.

### P0 — broken output or data loss

| # | Finding | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0-1 | `adm-zip@0.6.0` high + moderate advisories | `pnpm audit --prod` exit 1 | Fixed |
| P0-2 | `import a.md -o a.MD` overwrote the Markdown **source** with JSON — the guard was a case-sensitive string compare | reproduced | Fixed |
| P0-3 | `cleanInline` corrupted ordinary prose: `my_file_name` → `myfilename`, `2 * 3 * 4` → `2  3  4`, `if a < b > c then` → `if a  c then`; `<[^>]+>` also deleted every `<https://…>` autolink | reproduced | Fixed |
| P0-4 | `\text{if } x>0` rendered as `ifx>0` — whitespace was consumed before the script check and never emitted | reproduced | Fixed |

### P1 — wrong on real inputs

| # | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|
| P1-1 | `heading4` absent from the fallback table → 4th-level headings resolved to the body paragraph style | Fixed |
| P1-2 | Table width hardcoded to 8504 twips, contradicting its own 100% declaration | Fixed |
| P1-3 | Table typography hardcoded; template styles ignored | Fixed |
| P1-4 | Thesis and 公文 shared one fallback table, so a thesis without a template body rendered as 仿宋 三号 | Fixed |
| P1-5 | Parser ignored `w:pPr/w:rPr` | Fixed |
| P1-6 | `w:firstLineChars` / `leftChars` / `rightChars` are hundredths of a *character* but were stored as twips (`200` instead of `480`) | Fixed |
| P1-7 | Unanchored `/^(表\|Table\|题注)/` matched Word's built-in `TableGrid` and `Table of Contents`, turning them into level-3 headings | Fixed |
| P1-8 | Role detection ignored `w:type`, so character (`uChar`, `Hyperlink`), table and numbering styles were all assigned `paragraph`; `resolveStyle` then picked whichever came first in the XML | Fixed |
| P1-9 | No pattern ever produced the `equation` role, so a template's equation style (`MTConvertedEquation`) could never be used | **Overstated — corrected.** The `equation` pattern was added, but `MTConvertedEquation` is a `w:type="character"` style and `detectStyleRoles` skips every non-paragraph style, so that specific style still receives no role (confirmed against the shipped asset: the key is absent from both `styleRoles` and `roleWinners`). What the fix does deliver is a role for *paragraph*-level equation styles (`公式`, `Equation`). Assigning `equation` to a character style would be meaningless anyway — the renderer styles a paragraph, and a character style carries no paragraph properties |
| P1-10 | `mathComponents` had no `default` case → an unhandled AST node put `undefined` into the OMML children array | Fixed |
| P1-11 | Equation parse failures were swallowed by a bare `catch` with no diagnostic | Fixed |
| P1-12 | `--flag=value` was silently ignored: `import x.md --type=official` exited 0 and produced `"type":"thesis"`; `init --type=journal` wrote `thesis-content.json` | Fixed |
| P1-13 | Unknown flags were silently ignored: `build x.json --out zzz.docx` wrote `x.docx` | Fixed |
| P1-14 | UTF-8-BOM JSON input failed with `Unexpected token '\uFEFF'` | Fixed |
| P1-15 | Front-matter block sequences (`keywords:` + `- item`) were skipped and the key became `""` | Fixed |
| P1-16 | Quoted list elements were split before quote handling: `["a, b", c]` → `['"a','b"','c']` | Fixed |
| P1-17 | `# C#` lost its `#`; the closing-hash pattern did not require a preceding space | Fixed |
| P1-18 | Single-column tables were never detected (separator regex required a second pipe group) | Fixed |
| P1-19 | A fence with an extended info string (` ```js title=x `) failed to match, so the opener became a paragraph and the closing fence swallowed the rest of the file | Fixed |
| P1-20 | `latexToPlainText` used an ordered replace chain, so any command that prefixes another was corrupted: `\propto` → `Πto`, `\cdots` → `·s`, `\simeq` → `∼eq` | Fixed |
| P1-21 | Bare `x^2` / `x_1` were left as literal caret/underscore | Fixed |
| P1-22 | `[^}]+` cannot match nested braces, so `\frac{a_{1}}{b}` leaked as `\fraca_1/b` | Fixed |
| P1-23 | `/\\(left\|right)\s*/` also matched `\leftarrow`, so the real `\right` was eaten and the delimiter swallowed the rest of the equation | Fixed |

### P2 — correctness and maintainability

Status: **Fixed** = changed on this branch with a regression test. Every finding
in the table below is now closed; the notes record what each fix does. §6 lists
what remains outside this table.

| # | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|
| P2-1 | `latexToOMML` falls back to Unicode whenever pandoc is missing **or fails for any reason**, silently. | Fixed — `convertLatexToOmml` returns `{ source, lossy, reason }`, and `latexToOMML` warns. |
| P2-2 | `\operatorname*{argmax}_{x}`: the `*` is not consumed, yielding an empty function name plus a stray run and group. | Fixed |
| P2-3 | `\begin{aligned}…\end{matrix}` (mismatched name) silently consumes the rest of the input as the environment body. | Fixed — the scanner stops at depth 0 and leaves the index at the mismatched `\end`. |
| P2-4 | Unknown commands lose their backslash in the AST (`\foo` → run `foo`). | Fixed — `\foo` now stays `\foo`; escaped literals (`\%`) are still bare. |
| P2-5 | `x^{a}^{b}` silently overwrites the first superscript. | Fixed — the first wins. |
| P2-6 | Escaped `&` after a row break is mis-detected (`\\&`), merging two cells into one. | Fixed — a character is escaped by an *odd* run of backslashes, so `\\&` is a row break plus a separator and `\&` stays literal. |
| P2-7 | Only the body-level `w:sectPr` is read; paragraph-level section breaks are ignored. | Fixed — all sections are collected into `pageSections`; only the last is rendered, and that is now warned about. |
| P2-8 | `removeNSPrefix: false` hardcodes the `w:` prefix; a styles.xml using another prefix yields a zero-style template with no error. | Fixed — the prefix bound to the WordprocessingML namespace is read from the document's own declaration and normalised to `w:` before parsing, so an `x:styles` template parses like any other. A template that still declares nothing keeps its warning. |
| P2-9 | `basedOn` cycles are accepted and produce order-dependent merges. | Fixed — a loop is cut at its earliest-declared member, so the merge no longer depends on the entry point, and the loop is reported as a warning. A `basedOn` pointing at a missing style still warns. |
| P2-10 | `lineSpacing` stores the raw `w:line` and drops `lineRule`, so `auto` (240ths) and `exact` (twips) are conflated. | Fixed — `ParagraphStyle.lineSpacingRule` carries the rule from `w:lineRule` through to the rendered `w:spacing`. |
| P2-11 | Markdown list nesting is `floor(indent / 2)`, so standard 2- and 4-space nesting is mis-levelled. | Fixed — level comes from the marker's column. |
| P2-12 | `InlineRange` / `RichParagraph` exist in the schema and are referenced nowhere. | Fixed — both interfaces were removed. Nothing produced or consumed them, no block type can hold inline formatting, and the Markdown parser has no emphasis handling, so the types advertised a capability that did not exist. |
| P2-13 | Lists render as plain text runs with a manual `•` / `1.` prefix, not Word numbering. | Fixed — real OOXML numbering, each list restarting its own counter. |
| P2-14 | No document validator exists anywhere; the only runtime checks live in the renderer. | Fixed — `validateDocument` / `validateLegacyDocument`, run by `build`. |
| P2-15 | `$$a=b$$ trailing` mis-parses and then consumes following lines until one ends with `$$`. | Fixed — only an opener with no second `$$` starts a display block; the text after a closing `$$` becomes a paragraph. |
| P2-16 | A document starting with `---` and no front matter silently drops everything up to the next `---`. | Fixed — a `---` block is only stripped when its interior is front-matter-shaped, so a thematic break before a heading stays a thematic break. |
| P2-17 | An invalid official `category` silently becomes `通知`; `degree: PhD` silently becomes `undefined`. | Fixed — an unrecognised category is refused instead of coerced; degree spellings are normalised (`PhD` → `doctor`) and anything else is refused; `validateDocument` also checks `meta.degree`. |
| P2-18 | `resolveStyle` scans `styleRoles` linearly for every block — O(styles × blocks). | Fixed — `Object.entries(...).find(...)` materialised all 72 pairs before matching (9–11 µs per block, 18–24% of render time); the lookup now stops at the first match. |
| P2-19 | CLI: no `--version`, no stdin/stdout, no `mkdir -p` for the output directory, no overwrite protection for an existing output. | Fixed — `--version`/`-v`, `mkdir -p` for the output directory, an existing output refused unless `--force`/`-y`, and `-` for stdin (`build`, `import`) or stdout (`-o -`, with progress moved to stderr so the binary survives). |
| P2-20 | Agent-skill documentation mismatches. | Fixed — block sequences, fence info strings, caption precedence, H1 handling, `backMatter`, and the platform-specific validator path are all corrected. |

### Repository hygiene

| # | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|
| H-1 | 24 references to the pre-rename owner `1771902720-lgtm` across 13 files (CI badge, clone URLs, star-history chart, every `package.json` `repository`/`homepage`/`bugs`). GitHub redirects them, so they mostly work, but npm metadata should be canonical. | Fixed |
| H-2 | `drm-fix-report.json` — a 549-line personal research report (北京科技大学 动力松弛法) committed to the public repository root. | Removed |
| H-3 | `thesis-content.json` — a `thesis init` output artifact committed at the root. | Removed |
| H-4 | `.gitignore`'s blanket `*.docx` also blocked template fixtures, directly obstructing the roadmap item "get real university and journal templates to expand parser compatibility fixtures". | Fixed (`examples/` and `tests/fixtures/` are now exempt) |

---

## 3. What changed

| Package | Change |
|---|---|
| `document-schema` | `FontSettings.name/eastAsia/size` and `ParagraphFormatting.alignment` are optional — a parsed template declares only what it specifies. Added `StyleRole` (`BlockType` + `table_header` + `figure_caption`). |
| `template-parser` | Merge `w:pPr/w:rPr` under the style-level `w:rPr`. Convert `*Chars` indents to twips. Stop inventing fallback values. Skip non-paragraph styles when assigning block roles. Anchor the caption pattern; add an `equation` pattern. Order role assignment so an explicit or `w:default` style wins the renderer's first-match lookup. |
| `docx-renderer` | Split `THESIS_STYLES` from `OFFICIAL_STYLES` (GB/T 9704-2012) and add `heading4`, `table`, `table_header`, `figure_caption`. `resolveStyle` merges the template **per property** over the role default. Table width derives from `page.width − margins`; table and caption typography resolve from the template. Image width fits the printable page. Exhaustive `mathComponents` switch. Equation fallback now warns. Lists use real OOXML numbering with per-list restart. |
| `equation-engine` | Exact-command symbol lookup (no prefix collisions). Brace-aware group matching for `\frac`, `\sqrt`, accents and `\text`. Bare-script conversion. `\text{}` keeps its spaces; the insignificant space after it is dropped. `\leftarrow` no longer matches `\left`. `\operatorname*`, unknown-command preservation, environment-name mismatch, double superscript, and a conversion diagnostic (`convertLatexToOmml`). |
| `cli` | `--flag=value` support, unknown-flag rejection, case-insensitive input/output equality (plus output ≠ template), BOM stripping, `init` shares the same option reader, the documented `thesis <command>` prefix, content validation before rendering, and template-warning relay. |
| `markdown-parser` | Emphasis requires real delimiters (no intraword `_`, no space-flanked `*`); only tag-shaped `<…>` is stripped and autolinks keep their target. Heading closing-hash requires a space. Front-matter block sequences. Quote-aware list splitting. Single-column tables. Extended fence info strings. List level derived from the marker column. |
| `assets/ustb-thesis-template.json` | Regenerated from `《北京科技大学硕士学位论文模板》.docx` with the fixed parser: 72 of 72 styles carry formatting (was 0), and `roleWinners` records which style drives each role. Verified attribute by attribute against `《北京科技大学研究生学位论文书写指南》` — see §5. |

Test count: **29 → 99**, all passing. `pnpm audit --prod --audit-level high` now exits 0.

---

## 4. Reproducing the original defects

The probes used during the audit are reproduced by the regression tests added in
`tests/`. To see the original behaviour, check out the parent commit and run:

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm build
pnpm audit --prod --audit-level high          # exits 1
node --test tests/*.test.mjs                  # 29 tests, all pass
```

Then render a four-level heading, or a table on a narrow page, and inspect
`word/document.xml` — the probes are described in §1.1–§1.3.

---

## 5. The built-in USTB template — regenerated

`assets/ustb-thesis-template.json` was generated by the **old** parser and carried
no per-style formatting: all 72 entries resolved to one identical signature. The
renderer compensated with role defaults, so output was plausible, but the file
itself said nothing.

The source `.docx` (`《北京科技大学硕士学位论文模板》.docx`) and the university's
`《北京科技大学研究生学位论文书写指南》.docx` were supplied, and the asset was
regenerated with the fixed parser:

```bash
node packages/cli/dist/index.js parse "《北京科技大学硕士学位论文模板》.docx" --type thesis --org "北京科技大学"
```

72 of 72 styles now declare formatting (was 0), and the rendered output matches
the guide, checked attribute by attribute:

| Element | Guide | Rendered |
|---|---|---|
| 一级标题 | 黑体 小三 (15pt), 加粗, 居中, 段前/段后 17pt, 1.3 倍行距 | 黑体 15pt, bold, center, 340/340 twips, line 312 auto |
| 二级标题 | 黑体 四号 (14pt), 加粗 | 黑体 14pt, bold |
| 三级标题 | 黑体 四号 (14pt), 加粗 | 黑体 14pt, bold |
| 正文 | 宋体 小四 (12pt), 首行缩进 2 字符 | 宋体 12pt, firstLine 480 twips |

Two defects had to be fixed before that was true, and both were found by
regenerating against a real template rather than by reading the code:

1. **Role assignment ignored what the template uses.** Word's stock `heading 2` /
   `heading 3` carry a heading role by name whether or not anyone applies them;
   the USTB document sets every heading in its own `u2级标题` / `u3级标题`. Ranking
   by key order cannot fix this either — a plain object enumerates integer-like
   keys first, and Word names those stock styles `1`, `2`, `3`. The parser now
   records an explicit `roleWinners` map: a name-pattern match beats an
   outline-level guess, and between equals the style the document applies more
   often wins.
2. **`w:firstLineChars` lost to the stale twips beside it.** Word writes both
   `w:firstLineChars="200"` (2 characters) and `w:firstLine="200"`, and the
   converter only used the character count when the twips attribute was absent —
   so a 2-character indent came out as 200 twips instead of 480.

---

## 6. Suggested next steps

Items 3–5 of the original list are done on this branch, and the built-in USTB
template has been regenerated (§5). What remains:

1. **Add real university and journal `.docx` files under `tests/fixtures/`** — now
   unblocked by the `.gitignore` change — and assert parsed geometry and roles.
2. **Emit real section breaks** for templates that declare more than one section
   geometry — currently all sections are read but only the last is rendered, and
   the template now warns about it.
3. **Inline formatting** (P2-12): the two unused types were removed. Modelling
   rich runs means new schema, `markdown-parser` emphasis handling, and
   `renderParagraph` splitting `text` at range boundaries.
4. **Unsupported LaTeX diagnostics**: surface unsupported syntax on the rendered
   document instead of only through `convertLatexToOmml`.

---

## 7. Submission readiness against the template

Measured against two authorities: `《北京科技大学研究生学位论文书写指南》.docx`, and a
**139-page accepted thesis** produced with the template, inspected page by page
(PyMuPDF: fonts, sizes, per-element ink boxes, odd/even text columns).

### Verified in the rendered OOXML

| Property | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Page size / margins | A4, 上3cm 下2cm 左右3cm — the template's own `w:pgMar` |
| 装订线 1cm | `w:gutter="567"`; the thesis adds it to the **inside** edge only |
| 对称页边距 | `w:mirrorMargins`; thesis text columns alternate 4.00/3.00 cm and 3.00/4.00 cm on odd/even pages |
| 一级标题 | 黑体 15pt bold centred, 340/340, 1.3 倍行距 |
| 二/三级标题 | 黑体 14pt bold, 260/260; hanging 1cm / 1.25cm (thesis measures level 3 at 708 twips) |
| 正文 | 宋体 12pt justified, `w:firstLine="480"`, `w:line="312"` |
| 特殊标题 (摘要/目录/序/附录/致谢/参考文献) | `w:line="579"` (2.41 倍), 340/330 — asserted in `tests/docx-renderer.test.mjs` |
| 图题 / 表题 | 黑体 10.5pt centred; the table caption has its own role and spacing |
| 参考文献条目 | 宋体 12pt, hanging 1cm, 10/10/312 |
| 页码与篇眉 | three sections: the cover has no head and no number, the front matter is `upperRoman` from I, the body restarts at 1 in decimal. The heads come from the template's own `header*.xml` parts — odd pages 北京科技大学硕士学位论文, even pages the *document's* own title, since the text a template carries in that slot is its author's sample thesis — with the 篇眉 0.5 pt rule, and `<w:evenAndOddHeaders/>` reaches `settings.xml` |
| 每节的页面设置 | each part carries its own `w:pgMar` (the template's cover footer distance is 851, the body's 850), `w:pgSz`, gutter and columns |
| 封面三级样式 | `cover_title` / `cover_line` / `cover_meta` resolve from the template: 小二 18pt bold centred, 四号 14pt bold justified, 五号 10.5pt |
| 目录 | a `type: "toc"` section emits the 目录 heading plus a real `TOC \h \o "1-3"` field |
| 装订线 1cm + 对称页边距 | `w:gutter="567"` and `w:mirrorMargins`; the accepted thesis alternates 4.00/3.00 cm columns. `w:mirrorMargins` is read from `settings.xml`, where it is actually declared |

**One step stays manual.** The directory page numbers come from the `TOC` field,
which only Word can evaluate: after `thesis build`, open the document and update
the field (Ctrl+A then F9, or right-click → 更新域). A generator has no layout
engine, so it cannot know on which page a chapter lands.

### Not yet delivered

1. **Cover page layout beyond the three tiers.** `cover_title` / `cover_line` /
   `cover_meta` are in place and verified, but the guide's 表 4 also fixes the
   *positions* of those boxes (间距 5 cm, 书脊), which the content model still
   expresses as spacers.
2. **TOC entry styles.** The field is emitted, but `TOC1/2/3` are still mapped to
   `paragraph`, so the entries Word generates keep Word's own TOC formatting
   rather than the template's.
3. **Sections that do not line up with a part boundary.** The renderer emits the
   cover, the front matter and the body; a template that changes its setup
   mid-chapter (a landscape page, a two-column passage) is still flattened into
   whichever part it falls in.
4. **Automatic chapter numbering.** The template's `numbering.xml` produces `1`,
   `1.1`, `2.3.3`; the renderer emits real list numbering for lists but not for
   headings, so a heading's number is whatever the content JSON says.
5. **Not expressible at all** (needs Word, documented rather than attempted):
   rasterised auto-numbers, right-aligned equation numbers, TOC dot leaders,
   and English caption/title lines as separate styles.
6. **`w:docGrid`.** The template snaps text to a 312-twip line grid
   (`type="linesAndChars"` in the body); the writer library emits its own
   `linePitch="360"`, so a generated page will not break lines exactly where the
   template's does.

### Found by reading the template's own parts

The template package holds 47 parts; the tool now opens six of them
(`styles.xml`, `document.xml`, `settings.xml`, `document.xml.rels` and the
`header*/footer*` parts the document references), and still ignores the rest.
What reading them turned up, and what is still open:

1. **Chapter numbers exist only in `numbering.xml`.** They are bound to styles
   through `w:lvl/w:pStyle` plus the style's `w:numPr` (`%1`, `%1.%2`, `%1.%2.%3`
   for `1`, `u2`, `u3`; `附录 %1` from numId 4). A regex for `numPr|numId` over
   the parser's output is false, so nothing survives. Watch numId 0 on `u4` and
   the figure captions: that means "remove numbering", and a generator that
   treats every numId as "apply numbering" gets it backwards.
2. **`w:beforeLines` / `w:afterLines` are unparsed**, so `ua` reports 10 twips
   where the template means 0.1 line; and `firstLineChars` is converted with the
   style's *own* size rather than the inherited one, so `af8`/`aff` record 480
   where 420 is right.
3. **Equations change representation.** The template's twelve formulas are all
   OLE objects (8× MathType `Equation.DSMT4`, 4× AutoCAD) with WMF previews — it
   has **zero** `m:oMath` — while the renderer emits native OMML, and centres it
   where the template right-aligns at tab stop 8820. Its `MTConvertedEquation`
   style is `Cambria Math` italic and is never applied.
4. **`fixChineseFonts` is over-broad.** It strips every `w:*Theme` attribute and
   rewrites Latin `w:eastAsia` values to 仿宋. Harmless for this template,
   hostile to one that says what it means.
